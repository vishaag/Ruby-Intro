1. splat arguments take multiple arguments and stores it in an array
2. 2,3,5,6,7 ; 7,6,5,3,2 ;  -1 , 1
3. They are stored only once ie. has the same object_id, they are immutable. Strings need to be evaluated and then hashed. Whereas symbols can directly be hashed using their object_id.
4. They are the same operation with different names. .intern stand for internal representation because Ruby converts all string literals to symbols internally.
5. Conditional value assignment - It assigns a value only when the variable is Nil.
6. Lambda check the number of arguments, Procs doesn't. Procs after executing doesn't return the control the the method that called it, whereas Lambas do.
