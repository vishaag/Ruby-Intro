Goals

OOPs practice

Instructions
Implement a Ruby class ‘SearchResults’ that encapsulates SearchResults from Google. Usage of the class must be as follows:

 

SearchResults sr = SearchResults.new(:query => ‘ruby oops’)

 

sr.size # returns the number of results after scraping the first google search results page

sr.results # returns an array of SearchResult (another class) that encapsulates a singResult

 

sr.results[0].title # Returns the title of the result

sr.results[0].desc # Retuns the description of the result

sr.results[0].url # Returns the url of the result
