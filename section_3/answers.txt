1. SuperClass mismatch for class B. Ruby wouldn’t allow this case since it doesn’t support multiple inheritance.

3. If super is called in a method in a class, it calls the same method in the parent class. If it doesn’t find it in the immediate parent, it moves up in the parent chain until it finds it.

4. attr_reader takes a symbol and makes that variable accessible by Receivers. Same with attr_writer but it also makes is writable.

5. Include makes available the methods and attributes of a module to a class instance in which it is used in.
Extend does the same but it makes available to the Class and not the instance.
Require is used to import libraries (whole files) and prevents loading the same libraries twice. Usually imported in a whole ruby file and not in classes.
